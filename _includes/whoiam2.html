          I have always enjoyed making sure that things around me are able run smoothly and efficiently, and after working in the NHS I ended up earning a MSc degree in management. My enthusiasm for understanding how things work led me to a web development course at GA, where I obsess over writing neat, organised and readable code. My aim is to become a developer within a strong team where I can learn and further improve my coding ability.
