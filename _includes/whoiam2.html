          I have always enjoyed making sure that things around me are able run smoothly and efficiently, and after working in the NHS I ended up earning a MSc degree in management. My enthusiasm for understanding how things work led me to web development. After exploring different programming languages and beginning to teach myself to code, I realised I needed to take it to the next level. This is when I began studying at General Assembley.

          I have since discovered a love for coding. At the moment I work for Experian as an Optimisation Engineer. I work with JavaScript, HTML & CSS, as well as optimisation software such as Adobe Target and tag management systems such as Ensighten. I have also worked with Ruby, Node.js, AngularJS, React, and Ruby on Rails. I am always looking to learn new languages and frameworks, because more than just being a useful skill coding is a very rewarding skill.

          When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me reading crime fiction, playing for my 5-a-side team or keeping my chakras aligned practicing yoga.
